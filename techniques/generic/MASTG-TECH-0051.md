title: Tampering and Runtime Instrumentation
platform: generic

First, we'll look at some simple ways to modify and instrument mobile apps. _Tampering_ means making patches or runtime changes to the app to affect its behavior.

In mobile application security however, the term loosely refers to all kinds of runtime manipulation, including overriding methods to change behavior.
