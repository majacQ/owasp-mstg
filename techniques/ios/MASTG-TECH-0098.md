title: Patching React Native Apps
platform: ios
---

If the [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native "React Native") framework has been used for development, the main application code is in the file `Payload/[APP].app/main.jsbundle`. This file contains the JavaScript code. Most of the time, the JavaScript code in this file is minified. With the tool [JStillery](https://mindedsecurity.github.io/jstillery "JStillery"), a human-readable version of the file can be retried, which will allow code analysis. The [CLI version of JStillery](https://github.com/mindedsecurity/jstillery/ "CLI version of JStillery") and the local server are preferable to the online version because the latter discloses the source code to a third party.

At installation time, the application archive is unpacked into the folder `/private/var/containers/Bundle/Application/[GUID]/[APP].app` from iOS 10 onward, so the main JavaScript application file can be modified at this location.

To identify the exact location of the application folder, you can use the tool [ipainstaller](https://cydia.saurik.com/package/com.slugrail.ipainstaller/ "ipainstaller"):

1. Use the command `ipainstaller -l` to list the applications installed on the device. Get the name of the target application from the output list.
2. Use the command `ipainstaller -i [APP_NAME]` to display information about the target application, including the installation and data folder locations.
3. Take the path referenced at the line that starts with `Application:`.

Use the following approach to patch the JavaScript file:

1. Navigate to the application folder.
2. Copy the contents of the file `Payload/[APP].app/main.jsbundle` to a temporary file.
3. Use `JStillery` to beautify and de-obfuscate the contents of the temporary file.
4. Identify the code in the temporary file that should be patched and patch it.
5. Put the _patched code_ on a single line and copy it into the original `Payload/[APP].app/main.jsbundle` file.
6. Close and restart the application.
