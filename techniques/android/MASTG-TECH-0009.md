On Android you can easily inspect the log of system messages by using [`Logcat`](https://developer.android.com/tools/debugging/debugging-log.html "Debugging with Logcat"). There are two ways to execute Logcat:

- Logcat is part of _Dalvik Debug Monitor Server_ (DDMS) in Android Studio. If the app is running in debug mode, the log output will be shown in the Android Monitor on the Logcat tab. You can filter the app's log output by defining patterns in Logcat.

- You can execute Logcat with adb to store the log output permanently:

```bash
adb logcat > logcat.log
```

With the following command you can specifically grep for the log output of the app in scope, just insert the package name. Of course your app needs to be running for `ps` to be able to get its PID.

```bash
adb logcat | grep "$(adb shell ps | grep <package-name> | awk '{print $2}')"
```

If you already know the app PID you may give it directly using `--pid` flag.

You may also want to apply further filters or regular expressions (using `logcat`'s regex flags `-e <expr>, --regex=<expr>` for example) if you expect certain strings or patterns to come up in the logs.
